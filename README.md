# house-prices-advanced-regression Project

An enhanced structure for professional data analysis and machine learning projects.

## Folder Structure
- data/raw: Original data.
- data/processed: Cleaned and transformed data.
- notebooks/exploration: Exploratory analysis notebooks.
- notebooks/modeling: Model training and evaluation Jupyter notebooks.
- src/preprocessing: Python scripts for data cleaning.
- src/models: Model training and testing scripts.
- src/visualization: Visualization scripts.
- reports/figures: Plots and images.
- reports/summary: Analytical reports and insights.
- reports/model_evaluation: Model performance reports (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.).
- reports/metrics_tracking: CSV/JSON logs tracking metrics over multiple runs.

## How to Use
1. Place raw data in `data/raw/`.
2. Process data using scripts in `src/preprocessing/`.
3. Conduct EDA in `notebooks/exploration/`.
4. Train and evaluate models in `notebooks/modeling/`.
5. Save visualizations in `reports/figures/`.
6. Record evaluation metrics in `reports/model_evaluation/`.
7. Store performance tracking files in `reports/metrics_tracking/`.

## Recommended Reports
- Summary Report: Key insights, findings, and results.
- Evaluation Report: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- Metrics Tracking: Evolution of performance across runs.
